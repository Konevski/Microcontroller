###Task 1: Explain briefly how the various characteristics of an embodded system can be fullfilled. Which methods and techniques are used.


####Reactive system
-It can continuosly interact with outsid world, and also real-time data acquisition.
-it usually has deadlines especially when the system is exposed to higher risk
-the examples are; thermometer, an Arduino, messaging devices and google apps etc.

####Real-time system
- the time it takes to ensure that it delivers on timeand therefore it priments deadlines.
- it provides output within a difined or specific time.
- soft real-time system depends on deadlines to be more useful but a failure woundnt cause major problem or loss.(e.g, video games, televison programs) 
- Hard real-time systems must meet deadlines at all cost in time or most damage will occur (e.g, Traffic light)
- Multimedia systems that uses network

#### Continuous/discrete/hybird system
