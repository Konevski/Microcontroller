### 4. Embedded systems (LS)
- An embedded system is a microprocessor-based computer hardware system with software that is designed to perform a dedicated function, either as an independent system or as a part of a large system. At the core is an integrated circuit designed to carry out computation for real-time operations.
- E.g electronic calculators, GPS systems, fitness trackers.

### 6. Distributed systems (LS)
- Collection of autonomous computers connected using a communication network.
- E.g: Telephone, Emails, Electronic Banking, Sensor Networking
- The system requires Concurrent Components, a communication network and a synchronization mechanism.
- Is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems and the computer program that runs in a distributed system is called a distributed program.
