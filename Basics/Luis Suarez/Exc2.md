### 4. Embedded systems (LS)
- An embedded system is a microprocessor-based computer hardware system with software that is designed to perform a dedicated function, either as an independent system or as a part of a large system. At the core is an integrated circuit designed to carry out computation for real-time operations.
- E.g electronic calculators, GPS systems, fitness trackers.

Examples of embedded systems include:

central heating systems
engine management systems in vehicles
domestic appliances, such as dishwashers, TVs and digital phones
digital watches
electronic calculators
GPS systems
fitness trackers
Embedded devices are not usually programmable by a user â€“ the programming is usually done beforehand by the manufacturer. However, it is often possible to upgrade the software on an embedded device. For example, fitness trackers are embedded systems, but the software can often be upgraded by connecting the device to a PC and installing the new software.

Embedded systems can have advantages over general purpose computers in that:

Their limited number of functions means they are cheaper to design and build.
They tend to require less power. Some devices run from batteries.
They do not need much processing power. They can be built using cheaper, less powerful processors.

### 6. Distributed systems (LS)
- Collection of autonomous computers connected using a communication network.
- E.g: Telephone, Emails, Electronic Banking, Sensor Networking
- The system requires Concurrent Components, a communication network and a synchronization mechanism.
- Is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems and the computer program that runs in a distributed system is called a distributed program.
