#2 Bit-Predictor#

##Tinkercad was used to test this assignment, in the file there is a screenshot of the arduino uno circuit, the arduino code and a .brd file downloaded from tinkercad##

###In the circuit, the button to the left acts as Event 0, the one to the right as Event 1###
###The LED lights act as bit0 and bit1 of the predictor (00,01,10,11) the one to the left(blue) as bit0 and the one to the right(red) as bit1###

###Whenever a button is pressed, an interrupt happens and the state switches, and gets displayed by the LED lights###
