## Task 1: Explain briefly how the various characteristics of an embedded system can be fulfilled. Which methods and techniques are used?

All Embedded Systems are task specific. They do the same task repeatedly/continuously over their lifetime. - This can be achieved using loops that make the system act in a specific way.

Embedded systems are created to perform the task within a certain time frame. - Having deadlines that meet the worst case scenario runtimes of tasks set in place by testing or software.

Some embedded systems are designed to react to external stimuli and react accordingly. 

Embedded systems are built to achieve certain efficiency levels.


Microcontroller or microprocessors are used to design embedded systems.

Embedded systems need connected peripherals to attach input & output devices.

The hardware of an embedded-system is used for security and performance. The Software is used for features.


## Task 2: Give an overview of the attributes of dependability and show how they influence each other.

- Reliability: The system meets the all requirements in an acceptable way. We ensure this by using validation and verification. 
The higher the realiability the higher the validation and verification required.
The system is working correctly for the time it is required.
The system must be reliable in a way that a fault or failure does not lead to safety concerns.

- Availability: Scheduling/insuring that the system can react at a specific point in time when it's needed.
The system must be available for use at all times it is needed. 
Adding secuirty such as passwords, face id, fingerprint scanners and two factor authentication lowers avaiability.
The system is available at any given time.

- Safety: Catastrophic failures, operating the system under different conditions, such as external damage, hardware diffectes, etc.
Maintaining a system to keep it safe. 
Fault, a failure somewhere in the system, such as storign a 0 instead of a 1.
Using this fault to compute somthing else gives us an Error.
When the system fails to perform it's requirements, it's known as a System Failure. Not all errors cause system failures.
The system is safe for use based on the safety requirement, during it's intended use time.

- Security: Outside attacks (accidental or deliberate). Wireless sensors, hacking, emp attacks. If the device is hacked it lowers safety, for e.x. in a car.
The system is immune to external attacks, that may access information or try to change/destroy that information.
A security issue may lead to a safety concern.


## Task 3: Give a schematic overview on the main elements of a microcontroller.
