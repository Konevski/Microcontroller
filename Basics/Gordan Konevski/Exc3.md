# WATERFALL VS V-MODEL
## Different Phases of the Waterfall Model (source: https://www.educba.com/waterfall-model/):

- ### _**Requirement Gathering**_: As specific by words, we need to know and understand what we have to design, what we have to develop, its processes, what will be its functionality, etc. It provides input material to the product being made, and thus the upcoming product is studied, finalized, and marked. It also gives us the extension to decide the hardware or software requirements of the product which will be designed, developed, and captured in all phases.

- ### _**Analysis**_: 
- Requirement gathering and analysis: First all the information and requirement for the product development is gathered from the customer and then it is processed for analysis. The main role of this part is to eradicate incompleteness and inconsistencies related to software product development.
- Requirement specification: Then, the above-analyzed requirements are documented in an SRS (software requirement specification ) document. It serves as a path between the customer and the SRS development team. Any disputes in the future are managed and settled through this SRS documentation only.

- ### _**System Design**_: After the first phase is completed and verified, it is the next most important phase to be studied as it is used for system design. It helps in specifying software and hardware requirements for the product design.

- ### _**Implementation**_: With system design fully verified, the implementation phase comes in a row. In this phase, the inputs from system design are taken, and it is first developed in small programs known as units, which are tested and implemented in the upcoming phase. 

- ### _**Integration and Testing**_: Each unit design and development in the earlier phases are incorporated from the implementation phase, which is integrated into a module or system for various tests like load test, load test, etc., after testing each unit. The testing environment undergoes a constant software check to find out if there is any flows or error in the design or code. Testing is done to maintain the stability and feasibility of the software so that the client does not face any disturbances or bugs during its production. 

- ### _**Deployment of system**_: Once the non-functional, functional, alpha, and beta testing are done, the product of software is deployed to the user or customer system or is released to the market. The deployment phase includes installation, migration, and support of the complete system to the user or customer environment.

- ### _**Maintenance**_: It is the last but the most important phase in the waterfall workflow model.
Three types of maintenance:

- Corrective Maintenance: During the design and development phase, some errors are not discovered; they only take into account when the customer uses them. This is only corrective maintenance which means correction of issues or error which were not discovered in the development phase.
- Perfective Maintenance: This type of maintenance is carried out on customer requests to increase and enhance the functionalities of the system or software.
- Adaptive maintenance: it is the maintenance that is required for switching of the system environment. Usually required for porting of the existing system to a new environment or new computer or system or maybe with a new operating system. This phase is too important as this leads to better system performance.

## V Model Phases (source: https://www.guru99.com/v-model-software-testing.html):
- Requirement Gathering stage: Gather as much information as possible about the details & specifications of the desired software from the client. This is nothing but the Requirements gathering stage.
- Design Stage: Plan the programming language like Java, PHP, .net; database like Oracle, MySQL, etc. Which would be suited for the project, also some high-level functions & architecture.
- Build Stage: After the design stage, it is build stage, that is nothing but actually code the software
- Test Stage: Next, you test the software to verify that it is built as per the specifications are given by the client.
- Deployment stage: Deploy the application in the respective environment
- Maintenance stage: Once your system is ready to use, you may require to change the code later on as per customer request

## Differences between V-model and the Waterfall model
The main difference between waterfall model and V model is that in waterfall model, the testing activities are carried out after the development activities are over. On the other hand in V model, testing activities start with the first stage itself. So, perhaps the tool needs to be tested in parallel to its development.
